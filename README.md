# copypasta
An extended Linux terminal copy-paste tool

### Motivation
I have always found the `cp` Linux command underwhelming. It has always come far second to the traditional Ctrl+C Ctrl+V GUI approach, thus slowing down my workflow tremendously. The world needs a versatile CLI copy-paste tool, with its own clipboard registers and memory. And thus, the idea for **copypasta** was born.
